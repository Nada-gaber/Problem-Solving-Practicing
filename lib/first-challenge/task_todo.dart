// Here's a problem-solving question that combines Dart and Flutter concepts:

// Scenario: You're building a to-do list app. Users can add tasks with a title and description. They can also mark tasks as completed.

// Challenge:
// Data Model (Dart):
// Define a Task class in Dart that represents a single task. 
// It should have properties for title, description, and a boolean flag for completion status.

// Task List (Flutter):
// Design a Flutter UI that displays a list of tasks.
// Each task item should show the title and completion status (visually distinct for complete/incomplete).
// Clicking a task should toggle its completion status.

// Persistence (Optional):
// Implement functionality to save the task list to persistent storage 
// (e.g., SharedPreferences) and load it back when the app launches.

// Bonus:

// Implement a way to add new tasks with title and description input fields.
// Allow users to delete tasks.

// This question tests your understanding of:
// Dart classes and properties
// Flutter UI widgets (e.g., ListView, Text, Checkbox)
// State management (e.g., with StatefulWidget and setState)
// (Optional) SharedPreferences for persistent data

// Tips:
// Use a List<Task> to store tasks in memory.
// Consider using ternary operator or conditional formatting for displaying completion status visually.
// Leverage existing Flutter packages like shared_preferences for persistence (if implementing the optional part).
// Remember, there are multiple ways to solve this problem. The key is to demonstrate your proficiency in Dart and Flutter concepts.
